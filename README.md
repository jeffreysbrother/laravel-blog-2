# Laravel

* Views: `resources/views/`

To get started, you might have to install Valet and run `valet install` in the root directory. This would, ideally, allow me to visit `blog.dev` (or `blog.test`) in the browser, but this is not working at the moment.

To start database, run `brew services start mysql`.
